What is Computer Vision
	How to design computer that can understand and interpret information in images / video
	50% of cerebral cortex is used for vision
	Immensely useful for a variety of applications, like Object detection, road parsing, localozation, etc

Challenges in computer vision	
	Segmentation - Finding what to see
	Object Representation - What things look like
	Visual Learning - Of the what and How
	Interface to cognition - Reasoning about what is seen
